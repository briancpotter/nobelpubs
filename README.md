Dataset of Nobel-prize winning publications and biographical information on prize-winners in physics, chemistry and medicine between roughly 1915 and 2016 (it contains some earlier entries but isn't comprehensive).

This is based on combining biographical information from Nobelprize.org (obtained from [Opendatasoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/nobel-prize-laureates/information/?flg=en-us&disjunctive.category) and Nobel publication information from Li, Yin, Fortunato, and Wang at [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6NJ5RN).

I checked and expanded this data with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and ChatGPT o1.

### Limitations

Checking the paper references with ChatGPT o1 revealed that in many cases the defininitive Nobel-winning paper was not actually referenced. Because I was mostly interested in institutional affiliation and time work was done, I generally didn't fix these as long as the time period was roughly correct. If you need the exact paper references, it would be worth going through and trying to fix some of these errors.
