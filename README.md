Dataset of Nobel-prize winning publications and biographical information on prize-winners in physics, chemistry and medicine between roughly 1915 and 2016 (it contains some earlier entries but isn't comprehensive).

This is based on combining biographical information from Nobelprize.org (obtained from [Opendatasoft](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/nobel-prize-laureates/information/?flg=en-us&disjunctive.category) and Nobel publication information from Li, Yin, Fortunato, and Wang at [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6NJ5RN).

I checked and expanded this data with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and ChatGPT o1.
